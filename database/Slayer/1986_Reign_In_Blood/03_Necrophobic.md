Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain

Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged

<br>

Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air

Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair?

<br>

Ripping apart

Severing flesh

Gouging eyes

Tearing limb from limb

<br>

Experimentation, slow infection, internal decay

Execution, need transfusion, body rots away

<br>

Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs

Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

<br>

Ripping apart

Gouging eyes

Tearing limb from limb

Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air

Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair

<br>

Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs

Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

<br>

Necrophobic can't control the paranoia

Scared to die
