Modulistic terror

A vast sadistic feast

The only way to exit

Is going piece by piece

<br>

You have no choice of life or death

My face you will not see

I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath

Dismembered destiny

<br>

As soon as life has left your corpse

I'll make you part of me

No emotion

Death is all I see

<br>

Modulistic terror

A vast sadistic feast

The only way to exit

Is going piece by piece

<br>

Bones and blood lie on the ground

Rotten limbs lie dead

Decapitated bodies found

On my wall, your head!

<br>

On your trail I close the gap

One more life that soon won't be

No emotion

Your flesh is all I need

<br>

I'll send you to your maker

Confront the God you seek

A flash of red upon his your chest

Safety out of reach

<br>

(You have no choice of life or death

My face you will not see

I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath

Dismembered destiny)

<br>

(Modulistic terror

A vast sadistic feast

There's only one way out of here

Piece by piece)
