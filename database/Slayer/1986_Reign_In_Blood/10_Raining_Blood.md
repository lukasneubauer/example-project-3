Trapped in purgatory

A lifeless object, alive

Awaiting reprisal

Death will be their acquittance

<br>

The sky is turning red

Return to power draws near

Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears

Abolish the rules made of stone

<br>

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past

Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

<br>

Awaiting the hour of reprisal

Your time slips away

<br>

Raining blood

From a lacerated sky

Bleeding its horror

Creating my structure

Now I shall reign in blood!
