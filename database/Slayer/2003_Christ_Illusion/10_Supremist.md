Crushing all you worthless goals

I define control

Your pain's my fucking ecstasy

So putrid is my world of tyranny

<br>

To accentuate your desperation

Flesh from bone I'll rip and tear

I hate the fact that we breath the same air

<br>

Helpless as I dominate

I won't celebrate

Until you've all been crucified

I can not rest till everyone has died

<br>

I can't stand the victim in you

Infecting everything that I do

I will eradicate

Obliterate depopulate

Divine atrocious suffering

Cleansation of the weak

Supremacy

<br>

Pissing on your faith

Incinerate God's whore

Perpetual is my reign

I will eat your soul

<br>

Must maintain control of the weak

<br>

Must maintain control of the weak

Must contain the minds of the free
