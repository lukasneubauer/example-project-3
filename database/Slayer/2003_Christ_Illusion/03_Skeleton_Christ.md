Unbound God's creation

Has grown into the sinner

Abandoned innocence

Impenitent transgressor

Escape mortality

They say your life can change

If you take God's hand

Embrace rebirth

Your cleansing's so divine

To be reborn in God's eyes

<br>

You'll never touch God's hand

You'll never taste God's breath

Because you'll never see the second coming

Life's too short to be focused on insanity

I've seen the ways of God

I'll take the devil any day

Hail Satan

<br>

Your faith has atrophied

And rots in hell's asylum

Despondence tears you down

A free-falling social stain

Escape atrocity

They say your life can change

If you take God's hand

Embrace rebirth

Your cleansing's so divine

To be reborn in God's lies

<br>

You'll never touch God's hand

You'll never taste God's breath

Because you'll never see the second coming

It's all a fuckin' mockery

No grasp upon reality

It's mind control for

Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ

<br>

You'll never touch God's hand

You'll never taste God's breath

Because you'll never see the second coming

I laugh at the abortion known as Christianity

I've seen the ways of God

I'll take the devil any day

Hail Satan

<br>

You'll never touch God's hand

You'll never taste God's breath

Because you'll never see the second coming

It's all a fuckin' mockery

No grasp upon reality

It's mind control for

Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ
