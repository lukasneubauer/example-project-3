I have witnessed your death

I've seen it many times

Your tortured screams

Your decrypted little mind

A father's son

With pathetic eyes that bleed

Twins in the end

Begin and let the brothers fall

<br>

I will see you burned alive

Screaming for your God

I will hunt you down again for Him

<br>

God won't judge what I've done

He crawls upon my feet

A privileged pain

Beneath buried are your dead

On splintered bones I walk

Sifting through the blood

Besieged to fear

Await the coming of the God!

<br>

I will watch you die again for Him

<br>

Blood is raining downward

The stain reflects the sun

Conquer divide within

Terrorize the mind

I've seen the end it's yours

Rosary in hand

Your selfish flesh it melts

Spilling from the sky

<br>

I will see you burn alive

Screaming for your God

I will watch you die

<br>

This is God's war

God's war

This is God's war

God's war

<br>

War of holy principles

I'm seeking God's help in your destruction

Slit the throat of heathen man

And let his blood dilute the water

Bury your dead

<br>

Fuck your God erase his name

A lady weeps insane with sorrow

I'll take his towers from the world

You're fucking raped upon your deathbed

<br>

This is God's war

God's war

This is God's war

God's war

Fucking holy war

<br>

Be optimistic, happy, and calm

Show no fear or anxiety

Smile at the face of God

And your reward will be eternity

Holy warriors your patience will be justified

Everything is for Him

You must not comfort the animal before you kill it

Strike as champions at the heart of the non-believers

Strike above the neck and at all extremities

For it's a point of no return for Almighty God

God will give victory to his faithful servants

When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy

The Great Satan!
