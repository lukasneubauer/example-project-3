Terrorize frozen eyes stare deep in me

Paralyzed inside death breeds on your pain

Pretty lace lie in hate you wear my scars

Terrified you find that you push me too far

Your repulsiveness reminds me of dead flesh

Rotting corpse the smell of your putrid fucking soul

<br>

Petrified that I decide the moment of your death

Belongs to me the taste is sweet it's so unreal

<br>

Your God weeps, it bleeds, it begs for me

God is letting you recover

<br>

Welcome to my Black Serenade

The entrance of my hell your pain

Scream your song the Black Serenade

Live in fear a mind insane

<br>

Voice inside my head

Your face still shows itself to me

Telling me you're dead

Staring at your Lifeless body

I saw you fucking die

My mind's tearing itself apart

Screaming from the inside

Release this pain from my fucking heart

<br>

Destroy the empty shell

Smash away the haunting fear

I hate your endless stare

Watching as I fuck your corpse

<br>

Welcome to my Black Serenade

The entrance of my hell your pain

Walk through a tortured mind

You'll scream your song in time

<br>

Welcome to my Black Serenade

The entrance of my hell your pain

Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade

<br>

Live in fear no coming back

<br>

Welcome to my Black Serenade

The entrance of my hell your pain

Walk through a tortured mind

You'll scream your song in time

<br>

Welcome to my Black Serenade

The entrance of my hell your pain

Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade

Live in fear death back
