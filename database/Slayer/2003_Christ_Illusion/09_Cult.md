Oppression is the Holy Law

In God I distrust

In time His monuments will fall

Like ashes to dust

Is war and creed the master plan?

The Bible's where it all began

Its propaganda sells despair

And spreads the virus everywhere

<br>

Religion is hate

Religion is fear

Religion is war

Religion is rape

Religion's obscene

Religion's a whore

<br>

The pestilence of Jesus Christ

There never was a sacrifice

No man upon the crucifix

Beware the cult of purity

Infectious imbecility

I've made my choice

666!

<br>

Corruption breeds the pedophile

Don't pray for the priest

Confession finds the lonely child

God preys on the weak

You think your soul can still be saved

I think you're fucking miles away

Scream out loud, here's where you begin

Forgive me Father for I have sinned!

<br>

Religion is hate

Religion is fear

Religion is war

Religion is rape

Religion's obscene

Religion's a whore

<br>

The target's fucking Jesus Christ

I would've lead the sacrifice

And nailed him to the crucifix

Beware the cult of purity

Infectious imbecility

I've made my choice

666!

<br>

Jesus is pain

Jesus is gore

Jesus is the blood

That's spilled in war

He's everything

He's all things dead

He's pulling on the trigger

Pointed at your head!

<br>

Through the fear you're sold into the fraud

Revelation,

Revolution,

I see through your Christ illusion!

<br>

The war on terror just drags along

My war with God is growing strong

His propaganda sells despair

And spreads this violence everywhere

<br>

Religion is hate

Religion is fear

Religion is war

Religion is rape

Religion's obscene

Religion's a whore

<br>

There is no fucking Jesus Christ

There never was a sacrifice

No man upon the crucifix

Beware the cult of purity

Infectious imbecility

I've made my choice

666!
