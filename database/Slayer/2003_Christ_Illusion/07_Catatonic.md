Fear is just interpretation

Feeds my motivation

Our time together is

A bloodbath of serenity

Plead no more

There's no confusing the final

Excitation

My rancid passion is electrified

<br>

Accept this

My religion of torture

I can't see any purity

Just imperfection and obscenity

My blood soaked hands devise

Your slow methodic demise

Asphyxiate the world

It's blind without me

<br>

Catatonic

Catatonic

I'm numb in priceless solitude

Exhilarating keeping pieces of you near

<br>

Visions of decapitation

My mental masturbation

I try to resurrect

Your consciousness, your intellect

Once so pure

Your pain excites and tests me

Excitation

The empty stare emitting from your eye

<br>

Embrace it

My religion of torture

All I see are the impurities

The imperfections and obscenities

<br>

Accept this

My religion of torture

Excitation

The rancid passion coming from your eyes

<br>

My blood soaked hands devise

Your slow methodic demise

Asphyxiate the world

It's blind without me

<br>

Catatonic

Catatonic

I'm numb in priceless solitude

Exhilarating all the voices multitudes

I can't stop because it's so hypnotic

Catatonic
