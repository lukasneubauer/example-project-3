Take a deep breath

'Cause it all starts now

When you pull the fuckin' pin

The shrapnel burns

As it tears into the skin

Ever wonder what it takes

To be questioning your faith

This is what it's like

When it happens every Goddamn day

<br>

Violence is our way of life

<br>

Shards of life

Like confetti in the air

The flesh storm grows

As it breeds despair

You hear screams in the distance

Fighting the resistance

Not cries of war

These are just the sounds of pain

<br>

It's all just psychotic devotion

Manipulated with no discretion

Relentless War

<br>

Killing's in style

And it's now the main event

The cameras are whores

For The daily bloodshed

Like a junkie

Hungery for a fix of anything

The media devours

And feasts upon the inhumane

<br>

Violence is our way of life

<br>

It's all too fuckin' clear

We can never coincide

So let's all drink

To genocide

All the venomous sights

Border on the arcane

In times of war

Everything is bound by pain

<br>

It's all just psychotic devotion

Manipulated with no discretion

Relentless War

Warfare knows no compassion

Thrives with no evolution

Unstable minds exacerbate

Unrest in peace

<br>

There's no future

The world is dead

So save the last

Bullet for your head

<br>

Only fallen have won

Because the fallen can't run

My vision's not obscure

For war there is no cure

So here the only law

Is men killing men

For someone else's cause

<br>

It's all just psychotic devotion

Manipulated with no discretion

Relentless War
