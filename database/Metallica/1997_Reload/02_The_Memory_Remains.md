Fortune, fame

Mirror vain

Gone insane

But the memory remains

<br>

Heavy rings on fingers wave

Another star denies the grave

See the nowhere crowd, cry the nowhere tears of honor

<br>

Like twisted vines that grow

That hide and swallow mansions whole

And dim the light of an already faded prima donna

<br>

Fortune, fame

Mirror vain

Gone insane...

Fortune, fame

Mirror vain

Gone insane...

But the memory remains

<br>

Heavy rings hold cigarettes

Up to lips that time forgets

While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back

<br>

And can't the band play on?

Just listen, they play my song

Ash to ash

Dust to dust

Fade to black

<br>

Fortune, fame

Mirror vain

Gone insane...

Fortune, fame

Mirror vain

Gone insane...

Dance, little tin goddess

<br>

Na-na-na...

<br>

Drift away

Fade away

Little tin goddess

<br>

Ash to ash

Dust to dust

Fade to black

<br>

Fortune, fame

Mirror vain

Gone insane...

Fortune, fame

Mirror vain

Gone insane...

But the memory remains

<br>

Ash to ash

Dust to dust

Fade to black...

But the memory remains, yeah

<br>

To this faded prima donna yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

<br>

Dance, little tin goddess, dance

<br>

Na-na-na...

<br>

Say yes

At least say hello

Say yes

At least say hello
