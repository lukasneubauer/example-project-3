Suppose I say

I'm never satisfied

Suppose I say

You cut some root

To make the tree survive

<br>

Just let me kill you for a while

Just let me kill you for a smile

Just let me kill you once

I'm oh so bored to death

<br>

Ohhhh, I hunger

I hunger

I eat

<br>

Born Into Attitude

Asleep at the wheel

Throw all your bullets in the fire

And run like hell

Why cure the fever?

What ever happened to sweat?

<br>

Suppose I say

The vultures smile at me

Suppose I say

I've sent them down

And they plan to pick you clean

<br>

And satisfaction this way comes

And satisfaction this way comes

And satisfaction's here and gone, gone

Yeah gone again

<br>

Oooh, I hunger

Ooh I hunger

I eat

<br>

Born Into Attitude

Asleep at the wheel

Throw all your bullets in the fire

And stand there

<br>

Born Into Attitude

Twist mother tongue

Throw all your bullets in the fire

And run like hell

Why cure the fever?

What ever happened to sweat?

<br>

Just let me kill you for a while

Just let me kill you for a smile

Just let me kill you once for me

I'm bored to death

<br>

And satisfaction this way comes

And satisfaction this way comes

And satisfaction's here and gone, gone

Gone again

<br>

Yeah I hunger

Oooh I hunger

I eat

<br>

Born Into Attitude

Asleep at the wheel

Throw all your bullets in the fire

And stand there

<br>

Born Into Attitude

Twist mother tongue

Throwing all your bullets in the fire

And run like hell

Why cure the fever?

What ever happened to sweat?
