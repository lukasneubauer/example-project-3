Yeah, I feel you too

Feel, those things you do

In your eyes I see a fire that burns

To free the you

That's wanting through

Deep inside you know,

The seeds I plant will grow

<br>

One day you will see

And dare to come down to me

Yeah c'mon, c'mon now take the chance

That's right

Let's dance

<br>

Snake, I am the snake

Tempting, that bite you take

Let me make your mind

Leave yourself behind

Be not afraid

I've got what you need

Hunger I will feed

<br>

One day you will see

And dare to come down to me

Yeah c'mon, c'mon now take the chance

That's right

Let's dance

<br>

Yeah Come dancin'

<br>

One day you will see

And dare to come down to me

Yeah c'mon, c'mon now take the chance

That's right

Let's dance

<br>

Yeah, I feel you too

Feel, those things you do

In your eyes I see a fire that burns

To free the you

That's running through

Deep inside you know

Seeds I plant will grow

<br>

One day you will see

And dare to come down to me

Yeah c'mon, c'mon now take the chance

That's right

Let's dance!

<br>

It's nice to see you here
