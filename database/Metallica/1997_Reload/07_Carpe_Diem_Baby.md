Hit dirt

Shake tree

Split sky

Part sea

<br>

Strip smile

Lose cool

Bleed the day

And break the rule

<br>

Live win

Dare fail

Eat the dirt

And bite the nail

<br>

Then make me miss you...

Then make me miss you...

<br>

So wash your face away with dirt

It don't feel good until it hurts

So take this world and shake it

Come squeeze and suck the day

Come carpe diem, baby

<br>

Draw Lead

Piss wine

Sink teeth

All mine

<br>

Stoke fire

Break neck

Suffer through this

Cheat on death

<br>

Hug the curve

Lose the time

Tear the map

And shoot the sign

<br>

Then make me miss you...

Then make me miss you...

<br>

So wash your face away with dirt

It don't feel good until it hurts

So take this world and shake it

Come squeeze and suck the day

Come carpe diem, baby

<br>

Yeah, Suck it!

<br>

Live win

Dare fail

Eat dirt

Bite the nail

<br>

Strip smile

Lose cool

Bleed the day

And break the rule

<br>

Hug the curve

Lose the time

Tear the map

And shoot the sign

<br>

Then make me miss you... (Come on, Come on)

Then make me miss you...

<br>

So wash your face away with dirt

It don't feel good until it hurts

So take this world and shake it

Come squeeze and suck the day

<br>

Come make me miss you...

Come carpe diem baby

Come carpe diem baby
