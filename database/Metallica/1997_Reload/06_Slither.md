Don't go looking for snakes you might find them

Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them

Haven't I seen you here before ?

<br>

Ohhh, watch the puppets dancin'

Yeah, see the clowns fall down

Hey, tie your tap shoes tightly

Yeah, and wear them into town

<br>

See you crawlin'...

See you crawlin' in...

<br>

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them

Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them

Haven't I seen you here before ?

There ain't no heroes here...no....no more

<br>

Hey hey hey

Oooh, play the game so nicely

Oh, check, its your move now

Yeah, we're standing in this jungle

Yeah, with serpents I have found

<br>

See you crawlin'...

See you crawlin' in...

<br>

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them

Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them

Haven't I seen you here before ?

Have your heroes disappeared?

<br>

See you crawlin'....

See you crawlin' in....

<br>

So don't go looking for snakes you might find them

Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them

Haven't I seen you here before ?

No there ain't no heroes here.......no no

<br>

Haven't I seen you here before ?

No there ain't no heroes here.

<br>

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them...

Haven't I seen you here before?

Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them...
