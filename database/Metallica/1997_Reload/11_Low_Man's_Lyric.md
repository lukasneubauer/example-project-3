My eyes seek reality

My fingers seek my veins

Theres a dog at your back step

He must come in from the rain

<br>

I fall cause I let go

The net below has rot away

So my eyes seek reality

And my fingers seek my veins

<br>

The trash fire is warm

But nowhere safe from the storm

And I can't bare to see

What I've let me be

So wicked and worn

<br>

So as I write to you

Of what is done and to do

Maybe you'll understand

And won't cry for this man

'Cause low man is due

<br>

Please forgive me

<br>

My eyes seek reality

My fingers feel for faith

Touch clean with a dirty hand

I touched the clean to the waste

<br>

The trash fire is warm

But nowhere safe from the storm

And I can't bare to see

What I've let me be

So wicked and worn

<br>

So as I write to you

Of what is done and to do

Maybe you'll understand

And won't cry for this man

'Cause low man is due

<br>

Please forgive me

Please forgive me

Please forgive me

<br>

So low the sky is all I see

All I want from you is forgive me

So you bring this poor dog in from the rain

Though he just wants right back out again

<br>

And I cry, to the alley way

Confess all to the rain

But I lie, lie straight to the mirror

The one I've broken, to match my face

<br>

The trash fire is warm

But nowhere safe from the storm

And I can't bare to see

What I've let me be

So wicked and worn

<br>

So as I write to you (yeah)

Of what is done and to do (yeah)

Maybe you'll understand

And won't cry for this man

'Cause low man is due

<br>

Please forgive me

Please forgive me

<br>

So low the sky is all I see

All I want from you is forgive me

So you bring this poor dog in from the rain

Though he just wants right back out again

<br>

My eyes seek reality

My fingers seek my veins
