Gimme fuel

Gimme fire

Gimme that which I desire

Ooh!

<br>

Yeah!

Turn on... I see red

Adrenaline crash and crack my head

Nitro junkie, paint me dead

And I see red

<br>

One hundred plus through black and white

War horse, warhead

Fuck 'em man, white-knuckle tight

Through black and white

<br>

On I burn

Fuel is pumping engines

Burning hard, loose and clean

And on I burn

Churning my direction

Quench my thirst with gasoline

<br>

So gimme fuel

Gimme fire

Gimme that which I desire

<br>

Ooh

<br>

Turn on beyond the bone

Swallow future, spit out home

Burn your face upon the chrome

Yeah!

<br>

Take the corner, join the crash

Headlights, head on, headlines

Another junkie lives too fast

Yeah lives way too fast, fast, fast, oohhOH!

<br>

On I burn

Fuel is pumping engines

Burning hard, loose and clean

And on I burn

Churning my direction

Quench my thirst with gasoline

<br>

So gimme fuel

Gimme fire

Gimme that which I desire

<br>

Yeah-heah

<br>

White knuckle tight!

<br>

Gimme fuel

Gimme fire

My desire

<br>

On I burn

Fuel is pumping engines

Burning hard, loose and clean

And on I burn

Churning my direction

Quench my thirst with gasoline

<br>

Gimme fuel

Gimme fire

Gimme that which I desire

Ooh

<br>

On I burn
