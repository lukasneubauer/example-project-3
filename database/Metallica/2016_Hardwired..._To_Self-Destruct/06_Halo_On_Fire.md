Obey

Obey

Come won't you stay

Sincere

Sincere

All ends in tears

Endure

Endure

Thoughts most impure

Concede

Concede

But both shall we bleed

<br>

Oh, Halo on fire

The midnight knows it well

Fast, is desire

Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light

For the darkness won't go away

Fast, is desire

Turn out the light

Halo on fire

<br>

Allure

Allure

Sweetness obscure

Abide

Abide

Secrets inside

Deprive

Deprive

To feel so alive

Obey

Obey

Just don't turn away

<br>

Oh, Halo on fire

The midnight knows it well

Fast, is desire

Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light

For the darkness won't go away

Fast, is desire

Turn out the light

Halo on fire

<br>

Prayers cannot get through

Return to sender

Unto which of you

Shall I surrender

Twisting in disguise

Dark resurrection

Lighting up the skies

Wicked perfection

<br>

Too dark to sleep

Can't slip away

Open or close

My eyes betray

Beyond the black

Come won't you stay

<br>

Hello darkness

Say goodbye

Hello darkness

Say goodbye

Hello darkness

Say goodbye
