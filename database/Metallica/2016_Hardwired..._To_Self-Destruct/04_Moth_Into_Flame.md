Blacked out

Pop queen, amphetamine

The screams crashed into silence

<br>

Tapped out

Doused in the gasoline

The high times going timeless

<br>

Decadence

Death of the innocence

The pathway starts to spiral

<br>

Infamy

All for publicity

Destruction going viral

<br>

Light it up

Ah, light it up

Another hit erases all the pain

Bulletproof

Ah, kill the truth

You're falling, but you think you're flying high

High again

<br>

Sold your soul

Built a higher wall

Yesterday

Now you're thrown away

<br>

Same rise and fall

Who cares at all?

Seduced by fame

A moth into the flame

<br>

Twisted

Backstabbing wicked

The delusion absolution

<br>

Perjurer

Fame is the murderer

Seduce you into ruin

<br>

Light it up

Ah, light it up

Another hit erases all the pain

Bulletproof

Ah, tell the truth

You're falling, but you think you're flying high

High again

<br>

Sold your soul

Built the higher wall

Yesterday

Now you're thrown away

<br>

Same rise and fall

Who cares at all?

Seduced by fame

A moth into the flame

Burn

<br>

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself

The vultures feast around you still

Overdose on shame and insecurity

If one won't do that fistful will

<br>

Death scene

Black hearse the limousine

A grave filled with seduction

<br>

Vaccine

Fame does the murdering

She builds up for destruction

<br>

So light it up

Ah, light it up

Another hit erases all the pain

Bulletproof

Ah, no excuse

You're falling, but you think you're flying high

High again

<br>

Sold your soul

Built the higher wall

Yesterday

Now you're thrown away

<br>

Same rise and fall

Who cares at all?

Seduced by fame

A moth into the flame

<br>

Addicted to the

Fame
