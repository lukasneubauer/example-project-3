Chaos,

Awaiting for Adams return

Madness,

Smiling as we watch it burn

<br>

I've become

<br>

Hostage to my mind

Left myself behind

Blind lead blind

Quest to find

Faith in man(un)kind

<br>

Garden,

Of Eden, so simple and pure

Greedy,

Needy, must we have more

<br>

I've become

<br>

Hostage to my mind

Left myself behind

Blind lead blind

Quest to find

Faith in man(un)kind

<br>

Fascinate

Partner of insanity

Decimate

Lessons we never learn

<br>

Dominate

Killing of the innocence

Deviate

And to dust you return

Yeah

<br>

Seized by the day

Frozen captive by the night

Seized by the day

All the dark days of your life

<br>

Seized by the day

Frozen captive by the night

Led so astray

All the dark days of your life

<br>

Zero,

Reset, creation of man

Foolish,

Ready, to witness again?

<br>

I've become

<br>

Hostage to my mind

Left myself behind

Blind lead blind

Quest to find

Faith in man(un)kind

<br>

Faith in man(un)kind

Oh, faith in man(un)kind

Faith in man(un)kind

Oh, faith in man(un)kind
