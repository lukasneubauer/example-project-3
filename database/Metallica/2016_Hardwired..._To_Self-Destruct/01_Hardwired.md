In the name of desperation

In the name of wretched pain

In the name of all creation

Gone insane

<br>

We're so fucked

Shit outta luck

Hardwired to self-destruct

<br>

GO!

<br>

On the way to paranoia

On the crooked borderline

On the way to great destroyer

Doom design

<br>

We're so fucked

Shit outta luck

Hardwired to self-destruct

<br>

Once upon a planet burning

Once upon a flame

Once upon a fear returning

All in vain

<br>

Do you feel that hope is fading?

Do you comprehend?

Do you feel it terminating?

In the end

<br>

We're so fucked

Shit outta luck

Hardwired to self-destruct

Hardwired to self-destruct

<br>

Self-destruct

Self-destruct

Self-destruct
