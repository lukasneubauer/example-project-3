When darkness falls

May it be

That we should see the light

<br>

When reaper calls

May it be

That we walk straight and right

<br>

When doubt returns

May it be

That faith shall permeate our scars

<br>

When we're seduced

Then may it be

That we not deviate our cause

<br>

All sinners, a future

All saints, a past

Beginning, the ending

Return to ash

<br>

Now that we're dead, my dear

We can be together

Now that we're dead, my dear

We can live forever

<br>

When all is pain

May it be

It's all we've ever known

<br>

When flame consumes

May it be

It warms our dying bones

<br>

When loss has won

May it be

It's you I'm madly fighting for

<br>

When Kingdom comes

May it be

We walk right through that open door

<br>

All sinners, a future

All saints, a past

Beginning, the ending

Return to ash

<br>

Now that we're dead, my dear

We can be together

Now that we're dead, my dear

We can live forever

<br>

All sinners, a future

All saints, a past

Beginning, the ending

Return to ash

<br>

Now that we're dead, my dear

We can be together

Now that we're dead, my dear

We can live, we can live forever

<br>

Return to ashes, shed this skin

Beyond the black, we rise again

We shall live forever
