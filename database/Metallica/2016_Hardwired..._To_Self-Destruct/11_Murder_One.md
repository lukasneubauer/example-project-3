One crown

Shines on through the sound

One crown

Born to lose

One man

Does not give a damn

One man

No excuse

<br>

Aces wild

Aces high

All the aces

Aces 'til you die

<br>

White lines fading

The iron horse rolls on and on and on

<br>

Hear your thunder

Still feeding back

Still hear your thunder

The man in black

Born to lose

Living to win

<br>

One fist

Hammers through the mist

One fist

Steady on

One heart

Die hard from the start

One heart

Beats its song

<br>

Murder all

Murder one

Gimme murder

Second class to none

<br>

Headlights fading

The iron horse rolls on and on and on

<br>

Hear your thunder

Still feeding back

Still hear your thunder

The man in black

Born to lose

Living to win

<br>

Hear your thunder

Still feeding back

I still hear your thunder

The man in black

Born to lose

No excuse

<br>

Till the end

Been living to win

Been living to win
