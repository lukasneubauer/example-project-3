He sleeps under black seas waiting

Lies dreaming in death

He sleeps under cosmos shaking

Stars granting his breath

<br>

He wakes as the world dies screaming

All horrors arrive

He wakes giving earth its bleeding

Pure madness alive

<br>

And He haunts you

And He binds your soul

And He loathes you

And reclaims it all

<br>

You turn to stone

Can't look away

You turn to stone

Madness, they say

<br>

Cthulhu, awaken

<br>

He sways in abyss returning

Inhaling black skies

He shakes with a torture burning

All lost in his eyes

<br>

And He haunts you

And He binds your soul

And He loathes you

And reclaims it all

<br>

You turn to stone

Can't look away

You turn to stone

Madness, they say

<br>

Cthulhu, awaken

<br>

You turn to stone

Can't look away

You turn to stone

Madness, they say

<br>

Sanity taken

Seething damnation

Cthulhu, awaken

(Wake) Winged salvation

Death by creation

Cthulhu, awaken

(Wake) Dreaming no more

<br>

Cthulhu, awaken

(Wake) Dreaming no more

Cthulhu, awaken

(Wake) Dreaming no more
