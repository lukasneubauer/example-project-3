Ooooh,

Run away, the past will bite again

Ooooh,

No matter where you dwell

You,

Here again, a captive of the howl

You,

Welcome back to hell

<br>

Faithful, as the full moon is rising

Beauty and the Beast are colliding

<br>

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame

Deepened seed soaks angers reign

Arching back, shape-shift derange

Father, how I watched you change

<br>

Am I savage?

Scratching at the door

Am I savage?

I don't recognize you anymore

<br>

Ooooh,

Tooth is fang, twisting under skin

Ooooh,

Foul tongue, black breath

Change,

Snap inside, the Beast about complete

Change,

Soon infects the rest

<br>

Faithful, as the full moon is rising

Beauty and the Beast are colliding

<br>

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame

Deepened seed soaks angers reign

Arching back, shape-shift derange

Father, how I watched you change

<br>

Am I savage?

Howling at the door

Am I savage?

I don't recognize you anymore

Anymore

<br>

Ooooh,

Inheritance, the past has bit again

Ooooh,

The next heir of anarchy

Feel,

Stretching skin so far beyond belief

I feel,

The ever changing, you, in me

<br>

Am I savage?

Scratching at the door

Am I savage?

Howling evermore

Am I savage?

I don't recognize me anymore

Anymore

<br>

Anymore, ha ha ha

Am I savage?
